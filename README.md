## Accelerometer Feature Extraction Pipelines
This is a small package to flexibly create feature extraction pipelines from raw accelerometer
data. 
This was used to analyse data from Axivity AX3 sensors that sampled 
@100 Hz with +-8 g resolution.

NOTE: Currently functionality to calibrate to local temperature and gravity are not
currently included. For best results this should be done beforehand.
